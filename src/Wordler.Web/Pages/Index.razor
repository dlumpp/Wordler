        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">Wordle</a>-solving aid that aims to help you get unstuck by shuffling your letters.</p>

        <h3>What does it do?</h3>
        <p>Takes what you've learned about the word so far and shows you all possible letter combinations.</p>

        <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
        <p>Enter each known yellow or green letter in the corresponding row.
            If you know the same letter is yellow in more than one position then use the "plus" button 
            to add additional yellow rows.
            <em>(Note: Entering the same letter twice in the same row is interpreted as a double letter in the word.)</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Is it cheating?</h3>
        <p>It's debatable. I would argue that it isn't since it doesn't do anything
            you couldn't do with a pen and paper. No new information is gained. 
            I recomend full disclosure to anyone you share your solve with 
            so they can decide for themselves if you're a cheater.
